# hackBCA Tutorials

This collection of documentation and tutorials will help you as an organizer for hackBCA learn the languages and tools that we use so that you can make changes to the website yourself. Topics in this book will cover basic languages such as Python or Javascript, to more advanced topics such as managing a Linux instance on a cloud VPS or using MongoDB as a database. Although you will not be required to know every aspect of our website covered in this, we believe that this will be a good place to start learning something once you have to.

Along with each section, we will have a subsection dedicated to how that specific element is used for hackBCA. This will give a better sense as to why some technologies are used and their purpose to the tasks we work on.

As an organizer for the tech team, it is important that you make sure to understand each of the aspects you have to learn and use since the changes you make to the website will be public. We will be leaving various tips and guidelines throughout each tutorial, so be sure to make a mental note of them when reading. It will make everyone's lives easier if we are all on the same page as to how to go about doing certain tasks. 

If you are not an organizer for hackBCA's tech team, then feel free to learn from everything that we write about. The tips and guidelines are not rules and regulations, so you can take the ones that you feel are right. However, over the years of internships and practice with programming, we feel that the tips and guidelines are good practice that you can use in any project. 

We are constantly going to be adding to this collection with new topics and making old ones better, so check back often to get the latest version of this book. In the mean time, we hope that you learn a lot from hackBCA and how our tech team works. Happy hacking!
