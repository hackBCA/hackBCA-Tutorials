# Part I: The Basics

This part will cover some of the basic technologies/languages that hackBCA uses to create the website. These are the foundational elements that you will need to know before being able to work on all of the website. This part will not, however, cover the technologies used with these languages such as Flask, Sass, or Jinja2. Those technologies will be covered in later parts. 

Topics in Part I will include:

- [git](git.md)
- [Python](python.md)
- [HTML](html.md)
- [CSS](css.md)
- [Javascript](javascript.md)

If you already know how to use all of the above, we recommend moving onto Part II where more advanced topics will be covered.
