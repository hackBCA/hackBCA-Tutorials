# git

git is the specific version control system, or VCS, that we will be using for hackBCA. It is one of the most widely used one and is the basis for Github, the platform we will use to host our source code. If you don't already have a Github account, make one now so that you can contribute to hackBCA's website and other projects.

## Installation

We recommend using the command line tool as it is more versatile and will better help you understand the commands.

You can download git for your specific operating system [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Tutorials

There are a couple of the basic git commands that you will use for hackBCA:

- `clone`
- `push`
- `pull`
- `add`
- `commit`
- `merge`
- `checkout`
- `branch`

git has many more features that can help you when using it, but they have specific use cases and won't be used as often as the ones above.

The following are links to git tutorials that you will find useful. When going through these, be sure to pay attention to the commands listed above. Also, be sure to understand what version control actually means through the tutorials.

## git with hackBCA <sub>(pun totally intended.)</sub>

As mentioned above, git is hackBCA's VCS. You will be using git to make changes to our website or any other project we might be working on. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be talking about the website. Our website's repository has two main branches: `master` and `dev`.
